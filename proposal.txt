Project Name: Character Vault

Project Description: A project used to create and store created characters for any game you want. 
                     Simple at first but would be cool to get some templates, or even apis tied in in the future.

MVP (Minimum Viable Product) Features: Login/register with validations, CRUD on non user table with validations,
                                       routes outside of root protected via requiring being logged in, styled

Bonus Features: For sure some implamentation of bootstrap, if time permits tying in an api could be neat, or even
                some many-to-many relationships allowing people to like others creations
